# üõ†Ô∏è REMLA Project ‚Äì Operation Repository

This repository contains the setup and operational instructions for running the Restaurant Sentiment Analysis system, supporting both Docker Compose (Assignment 1) and Kubernetes cluster (Assignment 2) deployments.

## üì¶ System Overview

This system is structured according to the REMLA reference architecture and consists of two core services:

- `app`: The frontend/backend web application that interacts with users and forwards requests to the model service.
- `model-service`: A REST API wrapper around the trained machine learning model.

Both services are containerized and can be deployed via Docker Compose (local) or Kubernetes (production-grade), using pre-built images hosted on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

## üê≥ Running the Application

### Assignment 1 ‚Äì Docker Compose (Local)

Run the system locally using Docker Compose.

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed.
   - Access to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
2. **Login to GHCR** (if images are private):
   ```bash
   echo <YOUR_GH_TOKEN> | docker login ghcr.io -u <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> --password-stdin
   ```
3. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   - Access the application at: `http://localhost:3000`

### Assignment 2 ‚Äì Kubernetes Cluster (Production)

Provision a Kubernetes cluster with Istio service mesh to deploy the system in a production-grade environment.

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Vagrant and VirtualBox installed.
   - Ansible installed for provisioning.
2. **Provision virtual machines**:
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```
   - Creates controller (`ctrl`, 1 CPU, 4GB) and worker nodes (`node-<N>`, 2 CPUs, 6GB) using `bento/ubuntu-24.04`.
3. **Run final provisioning**:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -u vagrant -i 192.168.56.100, ansible/finalization.yml
   ```
   - Installs MetalLB, Nginx Ingress, Kubernetes Dashboard, and Istio 1.25.2.
4. **Istio Service Mesh**:
   - Lightweight Istio 1.25.2 installed via Ansible using `istioctl`.
   - Istio Ingress Gateway exposed on `192.168.56.91` via MetalLB.

**Operation Release**: [A2 Release](https://github.com/remla25-team20/operation/releases/tag/a2)
