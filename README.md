# üõ†Ô∏è REMLA Project ‚Äì Operation Repository

This repository contains the setup and operational instructions for running the Restaurant Sentiment Analysis system, supporting both Docker Compose (Assignment 1) and Kubernetes cluster (Assignment 2) deployments.

## üì¶ System Overview

This system is structured according to the REMLA reference architecture and consists of two core services:

- `app`: The frontend/backend web application that interacts with users and forwards requests to the model service.
- `model-service`: A REST API wrapper around the trained machine learning model.

Both services are containerized and can be deployed via Docker Compose (local) or Kubernetes (production-grade), using pre-built images hosted on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

## üê≥ Running the Application

### Assignment 1 ‚Äì Docker Compose (Local)

Run the system locally using Docker Compose.

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed.
   - Access to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
2. **Login to GHCR** (if images are private):
   ```bash
   echo <YOUR_GH_TOKEN> | docker login ghcr.io -u <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> --password-stdin
   ```
3. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   - Access the application at: `http://localhost:3000`

### Assignment 2 ‚Äì Kubernetes Cluster (Production)

Provision a Kubernetes cluster with Istio service mesh to deploy the system in a production-grade environment.

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Vagrant and VirtualBox installed.
   - Ansible installed for provisioning.
2. **Provision virtual machines**:
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```
   - Creates controller (`ctrl`, 1 CPU, 4GB) and worker nodes (`node-<N>`, 2 CPUs, 6GB) using `bento/ubuntu-24.04`.
3. **Run final provisioning**:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -u vagrant -i 192.168.56.100, ansible/finalization.yml
   ```
   - Installs MetalLB, Nginx Ingress, Kubernetes Dashboard, and Istio 1.25.2.
4. **Istio Service Mesh**:
   - Lightweight Istio 1.25.2 installed via Ansible using `istioctl`.
   - Istio Ingress Gateway exposed on `192.168.56.91` via MetalLB.

**Operation Release**: [A2 Release](https://github.com/remla25-team20/operation/releases/tag/a2)

### Assignment 3 - Operate and Monitor Kubernetes

Deploying our own application to kubernetes and monitoring

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Have a kubernetes cluster running as in Assignment 2 _or_ have a local minikube cluster running

2. **Install application via Helm chart**

   ```bash
   # This command requires you to run from the `operation` repository
   # KUBECONFIG is only necessary if you haven\'t added it to your global config
   KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig helm install app ./app-chart/
   ```

3. **Application connect**
   - The application will be available via the ingress-nginx-controller on [http://app.local](http://app.local) when you have added the following to your `/etc/hosts`.
   ```bash
   192.168.56.90  app.local
   ```
   - (OPTIONAL) need a flush of DNS cache as in assignment 2:
   ```bash
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder # MacOS
   sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches # Linux/systemd
   ipconfig /flushdns # Windows
   ```
   - (POSSIBLE PROBLEM) The ingress-nginx-controller should have external IP 192.168.56.90 by default, but if it is not working please check on which IP the ingress-nginx-controller is exposed with the following command and edit your `/etc/hosts` accordingly.
   ```bash
   # Again KUBECONFIG only needed if you haven\'t added it to your global config
   KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
   ```
